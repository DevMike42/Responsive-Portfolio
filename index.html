                <p>I’m new to the world of Web Development but I am working hard to learn as much as possible in order to make the big career switch. I’ve been a Bicycle Mechanic for 20 years now and am currently the Service Manager at the largest Trek Bicycles dealer in the country. I am hoping the skills I have acquired from endless hours spent diagnosing and correcting the many problems and noises on bicycles will help me to be just as precise and meticulous in coding.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am currently attending The Coding Bootcamp at UCSD Extension where the pace is fast and the material is extensive for sure. Despite the challenging nature of the program, I am enjoying it quite a bit and am starting to get my footing. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Upon completion of the course, I am hoping to make the big jump from one career industry to the next. I am anxiously looking forward to the change and excited for the challenges to come. Worst case scenario, I continue fixing bikes and am out $10,000. LOL</p>
